      <h2 id="request-process">Section 1 — Notification &amp; request process</h2>
      <p>The document states that mutual aid requests should follow this sequence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make a direct phone call to the Point of Contact (POC) listed on the current ROTr Mutual Aid Roster and/or request via the ROTr WhatsApp notification group.</li>
        <li>Provide: incident name/location, mission type, requested minimum pilot level (1–3), expected flying environment level (1–3), and estimated operational period (if known).</li>
        <li>After the initial phone request, a formal request should follow prescribed mutual aid procedures (Dispatch/ECC, Duty Chief, etc.).</li>
        <li>Sending agency confirms acceptance, ETA, and resource capability prior to deployment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="requesting-agency">Section 2 — Requesting agency expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly identify mission objectives, deliverables, and special requirements (e.g., thermal/IR, map production).</li>
        <li>Identify desired minimum required pilot level (1–3).</li>
        <li>Identify expected Flying Environment Level (1–3) if known.</li>
        <li>Ensure airspace deconfliction measures are in place (ITA, AirCo, etc. as applicable).</li>
        <li>On arrival, brief: hazards, aircraft activity (crewed/uncrewed), weather, ICS control structure, and the airspace deconfliction plan.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sending-agency">Section 3 — Sending agency expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure pilots meet FAA Part 107 or COA requirements.</li>
        <li>Confirm appropriate pilot classification level and aircraft suitability for the environment/mission.</li>
        <li>Validate currency, maintenance, and airworthiness of pilot and aircraft.</li>
        <li>Assume responsibility and liability for deployed aircraft and personnel.</li>
        <li>No personally owned UAS shall be deployed without IC approval.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="pilot-levels">Section 4 — Universal UAS pilot classification system (ROTr)</h2>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 1 Pilot — Advanced / Highly Proficient</h3>
          <p class="muted">Experienced pilot capable of complex airspace and multi-aircraft operations; advanced understanding of airspace integration, ICS coordination, night operations, and high-risk environments; can operate in Level 1 environments without supervision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 2 Pilot — Intermediate / Operationally Proficient</h3>
          <p class="muted">Moderate experience; operates independently in routine public safety missions and Level 2 environments; may need coordination support in high-complexity environments; sound ADM and regulatory knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 3 Pilot — Basic Pilot</h3>
          <p class="muted">Foundational training/certification; best suited for Level 3 environments with low airspace complexity and minimal hazards; may require supervision or operational oversight in dynamic environments.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 id="fec">Section 5 — UAS Flying Environment Classification (FEC)</h2>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 1 Environment — High Complexity</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Controlled/congested airspace, near airports, within TFRs (with authorization), proximity to crewed aircraft,
            potential BVLOS waivers, night operations, mountainous/canyon terrain, obstructions, reduced visibility/smoke, or adverse weather.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 2 Environment — Moderate Complexity</h3>
          <p class="muted">Class G operations with some challenges (terrain, moderate aircraft activity, wind/weather, limited nighttime). Coordination may be required; risks manageable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quick-card">
          <h3>Level 3 Environment — Low Complexity</h3>
          <p class="muted">Open Class G, minimal hazards, flat terrain, low population density, daytime VLOS, favorable weather, no nearby airports/aircraft activity. Suitable for basic/training deployments.</p>

          <tr><td>Surveillance (Law Enforcement)</td><td>Overwatch, perimeter control, suspect tracking, evidentiary documentation; requires compliance with privacy/legal/data retention policies.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Other</td><td>Any mission not otherwise classified; requesting agency provides clear objectives and environment level.</td></tr>
